<h2>THE TALE OF<br />TIMOTHY TURTLE</h2>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>
<h3>A FAMOUS BITER</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">That</span> black rascal, Mr. Crow, was not the
oldest dweller in Pleasant Valley. There
was another elderly gentleman who had
spent more summers&mdash;and a great many
more winters&mdash;under the shadow of Blue
Mountain than he.</p>

<p>All the wild folk knew this person by
the name of Timothy Turtle. And if they
didn't see him so often as Mr. Crow it
was because he spent much of his time on
the muddy bottom of Black Creek. Besides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">p. 2</a></span>
he never flapped his way through
the air to Farmer Green's cornfield, in
plain sight of everyone who happened to
look up at the sky.</p>

<p>On the contrary, Mr. Timothy Turtle
seldom wandered far from the banks of
the creek&mdash;for the best of reasons. He
was anything but a fast walker. In fact,
one might say that he waddled, or even
crawled, rather than walked. But in the
water he was quite a different creature.
By means of his webbed feet he could
swim as easily as Mr. Crow could fly.
And he could stay at the bottom of Black
Creek a surprisingly long time before he
came up for a breath of air. Indeed, Mr.
Crow sometimes remarked that <i>he</i> would
be just as well pleased if Timothy Turtle
buried himself in the mud beneath the
water <i>and never</i> came up again!</p>

<p>Such a speech was enough to show that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">p. 3</a></span>
Mr. Crow was not fond of Timothy Turtle.
Perhaps Mr. Crow disliked to have a
neighbor who was older than he. But Mr.
Crow himself always laughed at such a
suggestion.</p>

<p>"The trouble is&mdash;&mdash;" he would say&mdash;"the
trouble is, Timothy Turtle is <i>too
grumpy</i>. Now, <i>I'm</i> old. But I claim that
that's no reason why I shouldn't be pleasant."
And then he would laugh&mdash;somewhat
harshly&mdash;just to show that he knew
how.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of truth in what
Mr. Crow said. Timothy Turtle was
grumpy. But it was not old age that
made him so. He had been like that all
his life. There never was a time when he
Wasn't snappish, when he wouldn't rather
bite a body than not.</p>

<p>And that was the reason why he had not
more friends. To be sure, many people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">p. 4</a></span>
knew him. But usually they took good
care not to get too near him.</p>

<p>For Timothy Turtle had a most unpleasant
way of shooting out his long neck
from under his shell and seizing a person
in his powerful jaws. In spite of his
great age he was quick as a flash. And
one had to step lively to escape him.</p>

<p>If Timothy had bitten you just for an
instant, and then stopped, this trick of
his wouldn't have been so disagreeable.
But he was not content with a mere nip.
When he had hold of you he never wanted
to let you go. And it was no joke getting
away, once you found yourself caught by
him.</p>

<p>As for Timothy Turtle, he never could
understand why his neighbors objected to
this little trick of his. He always said
that it was more fun than almost anything
else he could think of. And it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">p. 5</a></span>
true that he never seemed so happy as he
did when he had caught some careless person
and was biting him without mercy.</p>

<p>"Anybody that wants to may bite <i>me,"</i>
Timothy used to declare. But perhaps he
never stopped to think that one might almost
as well bite a rock as his hard shell.
And anybody might better chew a piece
of leather than try to take a mouthful out
of his legs, or his neck, or his head.</p>

<p>So no one paid any heed to Timothy
Turtle's kind offer. Even Peter Mink,
who was himself overfond of biting people,
wisely let Mr. Turtle alone.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that it was the safer
way.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>
<h3>AN OLD-TIMER</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was pleasant for Timothy Turtle that
he lived in Black Creek, for he was very
fond of fishing. If he had happened to
make his home among the rocks on the
top of Blue Mountain he would have had
to travel a long way to find even a trout
stream. But in Black Creek there were
fish right in his dooryard, one may say.</p>

<p>It was lucky for him, too, that he liked
fish to eat. And whenever he wanted a
change of food the creek was a good place
in which to find a frog, or perhaps a foolish
duckling who had not learned to be
careful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">p. 7</a></span></p>

<p>It was no wonder that all the mother
birds in the neighborhood used to warn
their children to beware of Timothy Turtle.
Did not Long Bill Wren, who lived
among the reeds on the bank of Black
Creek, have a narrow escape when he was
only a few weeks old?</p>

<p>He had just learned to fly. And although
his mother had told him not to
leave the bank, he disobeyed her. When
she was not watching him he sailed over
the water for the first time in his life and
alighted on a flat object on top of a rock.</p>

<p>Bill supposed it was a stone that he was
sitting on. And he felt so proud of what
he had done that he cried, "Look! Oh,
look!"</p>

<p>His poor mother was dreadfully frightened
when she saw him.</p>

<p>"Come back!" she shrieked. "You're
in great danger!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">p. 8</a></span></p>

<p>So Bill flew back to the bank as fast as
he could go.</p>

<p>"What have I told you about Timothy
Turtle?" his mother asked him sharply.</p>

<p>"You've said to keep away from him,
or he might eat me," young Bill faltered.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" his mother cried. "And
the moment I glance away, here you go
and sit right on his back! It's a wonder
you're alive."</p>

<p>Her son hung his head. And never
again did he pick out a perch until he was
sure it wasn't old Mr. Turtle.</p>

<p>When he was older, and had children of
his own, Long Bill often remarked that it
was too bad Mr. Turtle didn't live in some
other place. "He makes my wife so nervous!"
he used to exclaim. "With a new
brood of at least a half-dozen youngsters
to take care of every summer one has to
watch sharp for Mr. Turtle whenever the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">p. 9</a></span>
children play near the water." And Long
Bill always took pains to tell his children
of his own adventure with Timothy Turtle
and warn them not to make such a
mistake.</p>

<p>"Luckily I sat exactly in the center of
Mr. Turtle's shell, so he couldn't reach
me," Long Bill was explaining to his family
one day. "But if I had happened to
perch on his head I certainly wouldn't be
here now."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Turtle is too slow to catch
me," one of the youngsters boasted. "I
saw him on the bank to-day; and he only
<i>crawled</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah! You don't know him," Long Bill
Wren replied. "When he wants to, he
can stand up on his hind legs as quick as
a wink. And he can dart his head out just
like a snake."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" Long Bill's small son shivered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">p. 10</a></span>
as he spoke. "I wish Mr. Turtle would
go away from our creek."</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> thinks it's <i>his</i> creek," Long Bill
Wren observed. "He has lived in it years
and years and years. We'll have to get
on with him as best we can, for there's
no doubt that Timothy Turtle is here to
stay."</p>

<h3>TIMOTHY'S GRUDGE</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sometimes</span> Fatty Coon liked a taste of
fresh fish, just by way of a change from
Farmer Green's corn, and blackberries,
wild grapes, bugs&mdash;and all the other dainties
on which he dined.</p>

<p>So it happened that one day he visited
Black Creek, where he crouched near the
water with the hope that some silly fish
would swim within reach of his sharp
claws.</p>

<p>For a long time he waited patiently.
And at last, to his great joy, a young pickerel
nosed his way through the shallow
water in front of him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">p. 12</a></span></p>

<p>The newcomer was hunting flies. And
he did not notice the eager fisherman.</p>

<p>Fatty Coon waited until just the right
moment. And then one of his paws
darted suddenly into the water.</p>

<p>But instead of Fatty Coon catching the
pickerel, someone else caught Fatty Coon.</p>

<p>His captor was no less a person than
Timothy Turtle himself, who had been
buried all this time in the mud almost
under Fatty Coon's nose. That is, his
body was buried. His head and neck he
had left free, so that he might strike at a
fish when one came his way. But he had
seen something else that took his fancy.
When Fatty's paw scooped into the water
Timothy Turtle just <i>had</i> to grab it.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" Fatty Coon shrieked, for
Mr. Turtle's cruel jaws hurt him terribly.</p>

<p>"Why, this is fun!" Timothy Turtle
muttered thickly, as he took a firmer hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">p. 13</a></span>
on Fatty's paw. "Besides, I've been
wanting to talk with you for a long time."</p>

<p>"Then you'd better let me go," Fatty
groaned, "because you can't talk well with
your mouth full."</p>

<p>"I can say all I need to," Timothy Turtle
grunted. "And I know that if I
dropped your paw you'd run off."</p>

<p>"Hurry, then!" Fatty Coon begged him
piteously. "Hurry and tell me what you
have to say. And please talk fast!"</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle almost smiled.</p>

<p>"Am I hurting you?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are!" cried Fatty Coon.</p>

<p>"Good!" Mr. Turtle snorted. "I meant
to, because I've a grudge against you."</p>

<p>Fatty Coon couldn't think what he
meant.</p>

<p>"I've never done a thing to you," he declared.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not!" Timothy Turtle admitted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">p. 14</a></span></p>

<p>"But you stole Mrs. Turtle's
eggs&mdash;twenty-seven of them&mdash;and you
can't deny it."</p>

<p>Now, it was true&mdash;what Timothy Turtle
said. Hidden among the reeds one
day, Fatty Coon had watched Mrs. Turtle
bury her eggs in the sand, to hatch.
And when she had gone he had crept out
from his hiding-place, dug up her precious,
round, white treasures, and eaten
them, every one.</p>

<p>Well, Fatty Coon dropped his head in
front of Mr. Turtle. He was somewhat
ashamed, and frightened, too. And he
did not like to look into Timothy Turtle's
blinking eyes. "How did you know?" he
asked Mr. Turtle.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Turtle told me," said Timothy,
shifting his hold slightly, for a better one.</p>

<p>"How did the old lady know who took
her eggs?" Fatty persisted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">p. 15</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Crow saw everything that happened&mdash;and
don't you call my wife an old
lady!" Timothy Turtle spluttered.</p>

<p>"Very well! She's a <i>young</i> one, of
course," Fatty said hastily. "But I don't
know how I've harmed you."</p>

<p>"You don't, eh?" Timothy Turtle
snarled. "Then I'll explain. I meant to
have those eggs myself, young man!"</p>

<h3>A TIGHT SQUEEZE</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Timothy Turtle's</span> remark was most surprising.
It almost took Fatty Coon's
breath away. And for a moment or two
he even forgot the pain in his paw.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that
you like turtles' eggs!"</p>

<p>"Do I?" said Timothy. "There's no
better treat, in my opinion, than a tender
young egg, especially if it's well mixed
with sand. And, of course, twenty-seven
of them are twenty-seven times as good."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry&mdash;&mdash;" Fatty told him&mdash;"I'm
sorry that I ever touched the old&mdash;I mean
the <i>young</i>&mdash;lady's eggs. And now that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">p. 17</a></span>
you've almost bitten my paw in two,
please&mdash;good Mr. Turtle&mdash;let me go!"</p>

<p>But good Mr. Turtle had no notion of
freeing his prisoner.</p>

<p>"Not yet!" he snapped. "I'm going to
bite you twenty-seven times as long, and
twenty-seven times as hard&mdash;if I can."</p>

<p>"But it was only a mistake!" Fatty
Coon moaned. "I never knew you wanted
those eggs yourself."</p>

<p>"Take care&mdash;&mdash;" said Timothy Turtle
sternly&mdash;"take care that you never make
such a mistake again."</p>

<p>"Don't do that!" Fatty Coon suddenly
cried.</p>

<p>"Don't do <i>what</i>?" was Mr. Turtle's
testy reply.</p>

<p>"Don't pull on my leg!" Fatty Coon
pleaded. "You'll have me in the water in
another moment, and I'll get wet, and my
mother won't like it a bit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">p. 18</a></span></p>

<p>But Timothy Turtle paid no heed to
Fatty Coon's objections.</p>

<p>"Certainly I'll pull you into the creek,"
he declared. "I'm going to take you out
where the water's deep, and drag you
down, down, down to the very bottom.
We'll have lots of fun burying ourselves
in the mud. And I venture to say that
you'll like it so well down there that you'll
never want to come up again."</p>

<p>If Fatty Coon was frightened before,
now he was terrified almost out of his
wits. And he began to claw frantically
at Timothy Turtle's head.</p>

<p>Luckily he had three free paws. And
of these he made good use. In the shallows
near the bank he struggled with all
his might and main. And soon the water
was churned into a muddy pool.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">

title='"Let Me In!" said Timothy to Mr. Frog.' width="383" height="551" /><br />
<span class="caption">"Let Me In!" said Timothy to Mr. Frog.</span>
</div>

<p>Fatty never knew exactly how he succeeded
in breaking loose from Mr. Turtle.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">p. 19</a></span>
Anyhow, he found himself free at last;
and he lost no time in scrambling up the
bank to safety.</p>

<p>Afterward Timothy Turtle always complained
that Fatty Coon didn't "fight
fair."</p>

<p>"He gouges," Timothy would explain.
"He'd just as soon stick one of his claws
into your eye as not. And I claim that's
something no real gentleman will do."</p>

<p>Now, Fatty did not leave Black Creek
at once, after his adventure with Timothy
Turtle. He paused for a time, to squat
on the bank and nurse his injured paw.</p>

<p>While he lingered there he happened to
glance up. And whom should he see, sitting
motionless in a tree near-by, but that
old rascal, Mr. Crow!</p>

<p>"Oh! Naughty, naughty!" Mr. Crow
cawed in a mocking voice. "You've been
fighting."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">p. 20</a></span></p>

<p>"It's all your fault," Fatty growled.
"If you'd minded your own affairs Timothy
Turtle would never have known anything
about those eggs."</p>

<p>"Bless your heart!" old Mr. Crow
cried. "Timothy Turtle would have
seized you just the same, if you'd never
touched his wife's eggs. You don't know
him as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not!" Fatty Coon replied.
"And what's more, I don't want to. I
never want to see Timothy Turtle again."</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow laughed merrily at that
speech. But Fatty Coon only turned his
back on him.</p>

<p><i>He</i> was in no mood for laughter.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>
<h3>MR. TURTLE'S MISTAKE</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Crow</span> was in no hurry to leave Black
Creek. And after Fatty Coon had limped
away the old gentleman still sat in the
tree which hung over the water. He
hoped that Timothy Turtle would crawl
out upon the bank and growl about Fatty.</p>

<p>The old black rascal was not disappointed.
Fatty Coon had not been gone
long when Timothy Turtle dragged himself
out of the creek and stretched himself
upon the sand in the warm sunshine.</p>

<p>"How's your eye?" Mr. Crow asked
him hoarsely.</p>

<p>"It's feeling better; but it's a wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">p. 22</a></span>
that I can see with it at all," Timothy
Turtle grumbled. "If I ever get hold of
that fat young fellow again I'll pull him
under the water before he knows what's
happened to him. He doesn't fight <i>fair</i>."</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow chuckled.</p>

<p>"You'll never have another chance to
show him the right way," he remarked.
"He won't come near this creek, or my
name's not&mdash;ahem&mdash;Mr. Crow."</p>

<p>"What's your first name?" Timothy
Turtle inquired, as he stared unpleasantly
at the speaker.</p>

<p>"Never mind!" said the other. "Mr.
Crow will do, if you want to attract my
attention."</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle frowned.</p>

<p>"I don't want to," he retorted. "The
fact is, I'd rather be alone. I don't care
to have strangers peeping down at me
when I'm enjoying a sun-bath."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">p. 23</a></span></p>

<p>"But I like to look at you," old Mr.
Crow assured him solemnly. "You make
me think of somebody I've known for a
good many years."</p>

<p>"Ah! An old friend!" Timothy exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;not a <i>friend</i>, exactly," Mr.
Crow explained. "He lives in the South,
where I spend the winters. You look like
him, in many ways."</p>

<p>"And his name?" Timothy Turtle said.</p>

<p>"Mr. Alligator!"</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle grunted.</p>

<p>"Humph!" he said. "I've never heard
of him."</p>

<p>"That's not strange," old Mr. Crow
told him. "He stays all the time in the
South and you stay all the time in the
North. You couldn't very well meet, you
see."</p>

<p>"Your tail is a good deal like his," Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">p. 24</a></span>
Crow continued. "And when you walk
you have a trick of raising yourself sometimes
on your hind legs, with your head
and tail stretched out&mdash;a trick that reminds
me of him."</p>

<p>For once Timothy seemed pleased.</p>

<p>"Anything else?" he demanded, with
something that was almost like a smile.
Unfortunately, he had passed so many
years with a constant frown on his face
that smiling actually hurt him.</p>

<p>"Why, yes! There is something else,"
old Mr. Crow went on. "You and he have
the same way of <i>snapping</i> at things."</p>

<p>There was no doubt, now, that Timothy
Turtle was gratified.</p>

<p>"He must be a fine bird&mdash;this Mr. Alligator!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow spluttered. And he had
to hang on tight to save himself from
tumbling off his perch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">p. 25</a></span></p>

<p>A bird! Timothy Turtle thought that
Mr. Alligator was a bird!</p>

<p>The mistake was so amusing that Mr.
Crow wanted to laugh. But he knew that
would never do&mdash;if he wanted any more
fun with Timothy Turtle.</p>

<p>So he pretended to cough. And he
wrapped his muffler more snugly about his
neck, remarking that there was a cold
wind that day, even though the sun <i>was</i>
warm.</p>

<h3>MR. CROW'S KIND OFFER</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">"I suppose&mdash;&mdash;"</span> Timothy Turtle said to
his young friend, old Mr. Crow&mdash;"I suppose
Mr. Alligator is a fine flier."</p>

<p>"He's a very powerful fellow," old
Mr. Crow replied with a sly smile.</p>

<p>"Did you ever try to follow him?"
Timothy wanted to know.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow shook his head.</p>

<p>"No!" he answered. "I shouldn't
want to do that, because one never could
tell when he might take a notion to jump
into the water."</p>

<p>"Oh! Then he can swim, can he?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" Mr. Crow assured him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">p. 27</a></span></p>

<p>"Then that's another way in which he's
like me!" Timothy Turtle cried. "And if
I could only fly, I'd be still more like
him."</p>

<p>"Why don't you learn?" Mr. Crow suggested
wickedly.</p>

<p>"I'm too old," Timothy sighed.</p>

<p>"Not at all!" Mr. Crow hastened to assure
him. "One can never be too old to
<i>try</i> a thing."</p>

<p>But Timothy Turtle replied that even
if he was young enough to attempt such
a feat as flying, he hadn't the least idea
of the way to go about it.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow was most helpful.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what you ought to do,"
he advised. "You swim down the creek
as far as the big bluff. And it will be a
simple matter for you to climb up to the
top of the bluff and jump off the rock that
hangs high up over the water."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">p. 28</a></span></p>

<p>Timothy Turtle looked far from happy
at that suggestion.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't care to do that," he said.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Mr. Crow asked him.
"You know there's only one way of
flying, and that's through the air."</p>

<p>"I might fall," Timothy objected.</p>

<p>"What if you did?" said Mr. Crow
glibly. "You'd only fall into the water.
And everybody agrees that you're a fine
swimmer.... You aren't afraid of getting
your feet wet, are you?" And he
laughed loudly at his own joke.</p>

<p>For some reason Timothy lost his temper.
Perhaps he thought Mr. Crow was
disrespectful to his elders.</p>

<p>"Look here, young man!" he snapped,
glaring angrily at old Mr. Crow. "If
you're laughing at me, I'll invite you to
drop down here and stand on the end of
my nose."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">p. 29</a></span></p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow grew sober at once. The
mere thought of perching himself in so
dangerous a place was enough to put a
quick end to his noisy <i>haw-haws</i>.</p>

<p>"My dear sir!" he cried. "I wouldn't
<i>dream</i> of standing on the nose of a fine
old gentleman like you. No indeedy! My
manners are too good for that."</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle said bluntly that he had
always been told that Mr. Crow was the
rudest person in all Pleasant Valley&mdash;unless
it was Mr. Crow's boisterous cousin,
Jasper Jay.</p>

<p>When he heard that, Mr. Crow pretended
to wipe a tear away from each of
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I've always been misunderstood," he
declared mournfully. "I'm really a kind-hearted
soul. And just to prove to you
that I want to be helpful, I'll meet you at
the bluff any time you say, and tell you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">p. 30</a></span>
exactly what to do if you want to learn to
fly."</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle seemed to think that the
chance was too good a one to lose.</p>

<p>"I accept your offer," he shouted.
"And I'll start downstream this very moment."</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>
<h3>LEARNING TO FLY</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Timothy Turtle</span> reached the overhanging
bluff in a surprisingly short time.
But it must be remembered that he did
not walk there on land, but swam down
Black Creek with the current. When he
crawled out upon the bank he was glad to
see that old Mr. Crow was waiting for
him, on a pine stump that stood near the
water.</p>

<p>He failed utterly to notice that Mr.
Crow was not alone. Hidden in all sorts
of places were as many as a dozen of Mr.
Crow's friends. For the old gentleman
had invited his cousin, Jasper Jay, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">p. 32</a></span>
come to the bluff "to enjoy the fun," as
he expressed it.</p>

<p>"But don't let Timothy Turtle see
you!" Mr. Crow had warned Jasper.
"At least, don't let him know you're there
until after he has jumped off the big
rock."</p>

<p>Jasper Jay had given his solemn promise.</p>

<p>"And don't let him hear you, either,"
Mr. Crow had said. And Jasper had
agreed to that, too, although he said that
it might be a hard thing to do.</p>

<p>Well, Timothy Turtle crawled out upon
the bank and took a long look at the high
bluff above him, from which the great
rock hung over the water of the creek.</p>

<p>"I believe&mdash;&mdash;" he said to old Mr.
Crow&mdash;"I believe I'd better wait till to-morrow
before I try to fly. I've just had
a long swim, you know. And I want to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">p. 33</a></span>
feel fresh when I take my first lesson."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Mr. Crow exclaimed.
"Everything's all ready. You're not too
tired, are you, to climb to the top of the
bluff?"</p>

<p>"No," Timothy Turtle admitted.</p>

<p>"Then you've no reason for waiting,"
Mr. Crow assured him. "Coming down
will be much easier than going up."</p>

<p>"I dare say that's true," Timothy remarked.
"But I don't quite like to think
about this business of flying."</p>

<p>"Then you certainly ought not to wait
any longer," Mr. Crow urged him. "For
the longer you wait the more time you'll
have to think."</p>

<p>That appeared to Timothy Turtle to be
a good bit of advice. And yet he still
seemed uneasy.</p>

<p>"There's just one thing that troubles
me," he confessed. "After I've jumped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">p. 34</a></span>
from the rock I might find that I couldn't
fly. And I'd get a bad fall."</p>

<p>"But you'd land in the water," Mr.
Crow reminded him. "And that would
be much better than falling on the land....
I don't need to tell you," he added,
"that water is soft. And you're a fine
swimmer."</p>

<p>So Timothy Turtle yielded. And thereupon
he began to drag himself up the steep
bluff.</p>

<p>It seemed to Mr. Crow that he had never
known anybody to walk so slowly. But
then, of course, he was in a hurry to see
the fun. And it couldn't really begin until
Mr. Turtle should reach the big rock
and take the leap that Mr. Crow had suggested
to him.</p>

<p>Jasper Jay and the rowdies he had
brought with him stirred impatiently.
And Jasper said aloud to one of them:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">p. 35</a></span></p>

<p>"What an old slow-poke he is!"</p>

<p>"What's that!" Timothy Turtle inquired,
as he stopped and looked around
at Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>"I didn't speak," Mr. Crow told him.</p>

<p>Timothy glared at his teacher for a few
moments. And Mr. Crow began to think
that Jasper Jay had spoiled the fun. But
at last Timothy Turtle plodded on. And
when his back was turned old Mr. Crow
flew over to the place where Jasper Jay
was hidden and whispered to him that he
had better keep still or there would be
trouble for him.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>
<h3>TURNING TURTLE</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">So</span> Timothy Turtle struggled up the steep
face of the bluff. And as he neared the
top Mr. Crow began to hop up and down
upon the old pine stump. He was almost
bursting with silent laughter. But he succeeded
in keeping quiet. And now and
then he made threatening motions toward
Jasper Jay and his friends, who stuck
their heads from behind limbs of trees and
hummocks and bushes, lest they miss any
of the fun.</p>

<p>Once on top of the great rock that
capped the bluff and hung out over the
creek, Timothy Turtle clung there and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">p. 37</a></span>
peered down at the gently flowing water
below.</p>

<p>"What a long way it is down there!" he
called to Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>"Don't think about that!" Mr. Crow
cautioned him.</p>

<p>"Is this the way Mr. Alligator learned
to fly?" Timothy Turtle demanded.</p>

<p>"Don't think about him!" Mr. Crow
shouted. "Just jump out as far as you
can!"</p>

<p>"I believe I don't care to fly to-day,"
Timothy Turtle faltered, drawing back
from the edge of the rock. "I&mdash;&mdash;I'll
wait till some other time. You know, I'm
older than you are."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" said Mr. Crow. "When
I'm your age I shall still be flying as well
as I do now. It's nothing, when you
know how. Nothing at all!"</p>

<p>Urged by Mr. Crow, Timothy Turtle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">p. 38</a></span>
once more crept to the very edge of the
cliff and stretched his neck out as far as
he could, to gaze down at the black water.
And at last, after making several false
starts and drawing back to a place of
safety, he stood up on his hind legs, shut
his eyes, and hopped off into space.</p>

<p>Now, the moment Timothy Turtle
leaped from the top of the bluff a deafening
squawk broke the silence. Old Mr.
Crow <i>cawed</i> as loud as he knew how.
But the racket he made was as nothing
compared with the uproar of Jasper
Jay and the noisy crew he had brought
with him. They squalled with delight as
Timothy Turtle plunged through the air
like a stone. And when he landed upside
down in the creek, striking the water
with a great splash, the whole company
shrieked louder than ever.</p>

<p>"<i>Ha! ha! ha</i>!" Mr. Crow cried, holding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">p. 39</a></span>
his sides and rocking backwards and
forwards upon the old stump.</p>

<p>"<i>Jay</i>! <i>jay</i>! <i>jay</i>!" Jasper and his
friends bawled, hopping up and down
and cutting capers in the air.</p>

<p>As for Timothy Turtle, he made no
sound at all. And neither did he make
the slightest motion. The current of
Black Creek caught him and bore him
away down the stream. But at last he
managed to paddle ashore. And he pulled
himself slowly out of the water, and
lay upon the sand and groaned.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow and his cronies gathered
quickly about him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Mr. Crow inquired.
"Don't you like flying?"</p>

<p>It was some time before Timothy could
answer.</p>

<p>"I've had an awful fall," he moaned
finally.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">p. 40</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are you hurt?" Mr. Crow
asked him.</p>

<p>"Everywhere!" Timothy Turtle told
him. "I thought you said that water was
soft to fall into."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is <i>not,</i>" Timothy Turtle
declared. "I believe there's nothing
harder in the whole world.... I've
heard, sir, that you are very wise. But
for once, anyhow, you've made a great
mistake."</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow coughed&mdash;and winked at
his friends. "The trouble was"&mdash;he explained&mdash;"the
trouble was, you lost your
balance and landed in the creek upside
down. And of course you couldn't fly in
that position. It's what's called 'turning
turtle,'" he added, "and I might have
known&mdash;if I had stopped to think&mdash;that
you'd be sure to do it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">p. 41</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Timothy Turtle, drawing
a long breath, "I'll tell you right now that
I'll never, <i>never</i>, turn turtle again."</p>

<h3>A PLEASURE TRIP</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Almost</span> always the wild folk in Pleasant
Valley knew that if they wanted to see
Timothy Turtle they could find him somewhere
in Black Creek. But once in a
great while he liked to go on what he
called "an excursion." By that he meant
a pleasure trip to some spot not too far
away&mdash;never outside of Pleasant Valley.</p>

<p>Nobody meeting Timothy Turtle on one
of those journeys would have suspected
that he was bent on pleasure. Or at least,
nobody would have supposed that Mr.
Turtle had found what he was looking
for. Certainly if he was hunting for fun,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">p. 43</a></span>
he never looked as if he had discovered
any. For no smile showed itself upon his
face. Instead, he met every one with a
frown. And if a body gave him a cheery
"Good morning," just as likely as not
Timothy would answer with a grunt, and
pass on.</p>

<p>Naturally, when Timothy Turtle arrived
anywhere and told people that he
expected to spend a few days among them
they did not feel any great joy at the news.
On the contrary, they were quite likely to
say to one another, "I hope he won't stop
long," or "He looks more grumpy than
ever." And some would even remark
that they wished Timothy Turtle would
go home and stay there.</p>

<p>So no one of the Beaver colony was
glad when Timothy appeared in their
pond one day and explained that he intended
to be in the neighborhood at least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">p. 44</a></span>
a week. In the first place, the Beavers,
as a whole, were a busy, cheerful family,
who did not like disagreeable folk for
company. And in the second place, they
were spry workers; and they had little use
for anybody as slow as Timothy Turtle,
who never did any work at all.</p>

<p>It is no wonder, then, that as soon as
the news of Timothy's coming spread up
and down and across the pond, the busy
Beavers stopped their work and said
things about the crusty outsider who had
forced himself upon them. And almost
everybody went to call upon Grandaddy
Beaver and asked him what he thought
ought to be done.</p>

<p>Now, Grandaddy was a good old soul.
And he told the hot-headed younger members
of the colony to keep cool, which
seems a simple thing for them to have
done, swimming about as they were in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">p. 45</a></span>
icy water, which flowed down from
springs on the side of Blue Mountain.</p>

<p>"Timothy Turtle has been here before,"
Grandaddy Beaver announced. "I can
remember my great-grandfather's telling
me about his passing two whole weeks in
our pond. And though everybody wished
he would leave, he never harmed anybody,
because people kept out of his way."</p>

<p>"Well, he ought to work while he's
here," said a brisk gentleman, tugging at
his moustache.</p>

<p>"Timothy Turtle will never lift his
hand to do a single stroke of work," said
old Grandaddy Beaver. "He has already
spent a long life without working. And
he'll be lazy if he lives to be a hundred
years old&mdash;or even a hundred and fifty."</p>

<p>Now, a young chap called Brownie
Beaver heard all this, as he stood in
Grandaddy's doorway and peeped inside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">p. 46</a></span>
the house. And he thought it was a shame
that <i>somebody</i> couldn't make Timothy
Turtle mend his ways. To Brownie Bearer
it seemed that Timothy Turtle was old
enough to behave himself.</p>

<h3>A WARNING</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Timothy Turtle's</span> visit at the beaver
pond was just like all of his outings.
Wherever he went he was so disagreeable
and snappish that there wasn't a single
person in the whole village that didn't
wish Timothy had stayed away from that
place.</p>

<p>He was forever grumbling, complaining
that the fishing was poor in the pond.
And as for frogs, he declared that he
hadn't seen even one.</p>

<p>"Why anybody wants to live here is
more than I can understand." That was
what Timothy Turtle told everyone he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">p. 48</a></span>
met. And of course it was a poor way of
making himself welcome.</p>

<p>"Why do you come here, if you don't
like our pond?" people asked him.</p>

<p>"It's a change for me," was Timothy's
reply. "After I've spent a week with you
I'll be pretty glad to get back home again.
And I won't want to go on another excursion
for a whole year&mdash;or maybe two.</p>

<p>"It's twenty years since I was here before.
And I sha'n't care to come again for
forty, at least."</p>

<p>Now, such dreadfully rude remarks
hurt the Beaver family's feelings. And
when Timothy Turtle seized a fat lady by
the tail one day and wouldn't let her go
until sunset, her feelings were hurt most
of all. She cried that she had never been
so insulted in all her life.</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle merely said that she
ought not to object. He explained that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">p. 49</a></span>
he had been <i>giving her a rest</i>&mdash;for of
course she couldn't cut down a tree, nor
work upon the dam that held the water in
the pond, while he clung fast to her tail.</p>

<p>Well, this fat lady happened to be
Brownie Beaver's mother. And after her
disagreeable experience with the stranger,
Brownie made up his mind that he <i>would
make Timothy Turtle work</i>. That was
the worst punishment he could think of.</p>

<p>Whenever the members of the Beaver
family were not sleeping, or eating, either
they were gathering food by cutting down
trees, or they were mending their dam.</p>

<p>The dam always had leaks here and
there. And sooner or later every one of
them had to be stopped, before it grew so
big that the water would rush through it
and tear a hole so great that the pond
would be drained dry.</p>

<p>During his stay among the Beavers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">p. 50</a></span>
Timothy Turtle often crawled on top of
the dam and stretched himself out and
watched the Beavers at their task. He
said that if there was one thing that he
liked to see more than another it was "a
gang of men working." But he complained
that they ought to work in the
daytime, when the sun was shining, because
then it would have been "much
pleasanter for him."</p>

<p>"Don't you want to help us?" asked
the brisk fellow who had told Grandaddy
Beaver that he thought Timothy Turtle
ought to go to work.</p>

<p>That question actually made Timothy
snort.</p>

<p>"<i>Me work</i>?" he snapped scornfully, as
he glared at the speaker.</p>

<p>Everybody knew what he meant. And
everybody knew how Timothy felt, too,
when he edged along the dam and made a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">p. 51</a></span>
savage pass at the plump gentleman who
had spoken to him.</p>

<span class="caption">Timothy began to climb the steep bluff.</span>
</div>

<p>Luckily the brisk Beaver jumped aside
before Timothy Turtle's jaws closed on
him. And he did not say another word
to the stranger during the rest of his stay
at the pond.</p>

<p>But Timothy Turtle became quite talkative.
He stopped all he met&mdash;old and
young both&mdash;and warned them that nobody
need try to get him to work, for he
never had worked, and he never intended
to.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>
<h3>ON THE BEAVER DAM</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Timothy Turtle</span> was so angry that he
went about snapping at everybody and
everything. And since the whole Beaver
family kept carefully out of his way, he
had to content himself with setting his
jaws upon roots and sticks.</p>

<p>Now, the Beavers' dam was made of
sticks and mud. So Timothy found
plenty of chances to bite. And because
he could not hurt the sticks, no matter
how much he tried, nobody cared.</p>

<p>Really he acted in a most silly, surly
fashion.</p>

<p>Out of a corner of his eye Brownie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">p. 53</a></span>
Beaver watched Timothy Turtle closely.
Brownie had not forgotten how Timothy
seized his mother by the tail. And while
he was helping his elders on the dam, at
the same time he was trying to think of
some way to outwit Timothy Turtle.</p>

<p>It happened that just at that time the
dam needed a great deal of mending.
There were so many holes to be filled that
the Beavers worked all night long. And
in spite of all their efforts they saw that
even then a few leaks would have to go
unmended. But they did not get snappish
nor lose their tempers. They were
not like Timothy Turtle. Though he slept
a great part of the night, and waked up
to watch the workers early in the morning,
his temper was worse than ever.</p>

<p>He was paddling through the water
close to the dam when Brownie Beaver
called to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">p. 54</a></span></p>

<p>"You see that stick??" said Brownie,
pointing to a stout piece of box elder that
stuck out of the dam.</p>

<p>"I'm not blind," Timothy Turtle
snarled back at him.</p>

<p>"Well, please don't bite it, anyhow!"
Brownie Beaver begged him.</p>

<p>That was enough for Timothy Turtle.
The mere fact that he thought somebody
didn't want him to do a certain thing was
sure to make him do it. So without saying
another word he seized that stick in
his powerful jaws. And bracing his feet
against the inner side of the dam, half in
the water and half out, he pulled with all
his strength.</p>

<p>Now and then he turned his beady eyes
toward Brownie Beaver and frowned at
him, as if to say, "Don't give <i>me</i> any orders,
young fellow! I shall do just as I
please; and nobody can stop me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">p. 55</a></span></p>

<p>Timothy noticed that Brownie went to
a number of the other workers and whispered
to them. And when everyone to
whom he spoke called to Timothy and
asked him if he wouldn't just as soon let
go of that stick and grab another one, that
crusty old codger made up his mind that
nobody should move him from that spot.
He took an even firmer hold and tugged
as if he meant to tear the whole dam
down.</p>

<p>But the Beaver family knew that he
couldn't do any damage. And as soon as
it was light enough they all went home to
take a nap, leaving Timothy Turtle to pull
away to his heart's content.</p>

<h3>KIND TIMOTHY TURTLE</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> day long Timothy Turtle stayed on
the Beaver dam. And when the Beavers
returned in the evening, to resume their
work, they found Timothy still clinging
to the box elder stick.</p>

<p>To Timothy Turtle's deep disgust the
plump workers gathered round him and
laughed. He could never bear to hear
people laugh&mdash;laughing was so silly, he always
said. And now Brownie Beaver
laughed louder than all the rest.</p>

<p>"Look!" Brownie cried, pointing
straight at Timothy Turtle. "Isn't he
kind? He has stopped up that big hole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">p. 57</a></span>
for us all day.... And now"&mdash;Brownie
added, turning to Timothy Turtle&mdash;"now
if you'll kindly <i>stop working</i> for us and
move aside we'll fill that hole that's right
under you, with mud."</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle never felt more
ashamed in all his long life. There he had
been working all day long, helping the
Beaver family by plugging a hole in their
dam with his flat body&mdash;and he had never
guessed what he was doing!</p>

<p>He let go of the stick and sank hastily
in the pond, where the water was deepest,
to bury himself in the soft bottom. And
there he stayed and sulked for the rest of
the week, until his visit was done. If he
stuck his head out of the water now and
then for a breath of air, he was careful to
let no one see him.</p>

<p>He did not even bid the Beaver family
good-by at the end of his visit, but left in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">p. 58</a></span>
the middle of the day, when everybody
was sound asleep.</p>

<p>Grandaddy Beaver said it was no more
than one could expect of a person so rude
as Timothy Turtle.</p>

<p>"He was just like that in my great-grandfather's
time," the old gentleman
explained.</p>

<p>And all the rest of the villagers remarked
that Timothy Turtle was old
enough to have better manners. Certainly,
they said, the youngest Beaver child knew
better than to treat people in such a rude
fashion.</p>

<p>Brownie Beaver's mother especially announced
that she had never in all her life
met a gentleman who had treated her so
disrespectfully as old Mr. Turtle. And
she grew red and pale by turns as she recalled
how he had seized her by the tail
and held her fast for a whole day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">p. 59</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope," she said, "that by the time
he comes here again he will have learned
how to behave himself."</p>

<p>But Grandaddy Beaver shook his head.</p>

<p>"Timothy Turtle," he declared, "will
be no different even if he lives to be a
thousand years old."</p>

<p>And everybody said that it was a great
pity.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>
<h3>THE PLOT</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the creatures that walked or swam
or flew, Timothy Turtle liked boys the
least of all. He said that if they ever did
anything except throw stones he had never
caught them at it.</p>

<p>"It's a wonder"&mdash;he often remarked&mdash;"it's
a wonder that there's a stone left
anywhere along this creek. I've lived
here a good many years; and no boy ever
spied me sunning myself on a rock in the
water without trying to hit me."</p>

<p>Once in a great while some youngster
was skillful enough to bounce a stone off
Mr. Turtle's back. And when the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">p. 61</a></span>
scamp flopped into the water he always
heard a great whooping from the bank.</p>

<p>At such times as likely as not Timothy
had been awakened from a sound sleep.
But when that jeering noise greeted his
ears he knew at once what had struck him.</p>

<p>It was a good thing for him that he had
a hard back. Nevertheless it always made
him angry to be disturbed when he was
taking a nap. And some people said that
if Timothy Turtle ever grabbed a boy by
his great-toe, when he was in swimming,
that youngster would limp for many a
day thereafter.</p>

<p>But the boys went in swimming just the
same. Black Creek would have had to be
alive with turtles to keep them out of it
on a hot summer's day. Indeed Farmer
Green often said that he wished his son
Johnnie would spend half the time in the
hayfield that he wasted around the creek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">p. 62</a></span></p>

<p>When questioned by his father, Johnnie
said that there was an old turtle in Black
Creek that he wanted to catch.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with him&mdash;make
soup of him?" Farmer Green inquired
solemnly.</p>

<p>Johnnie shook his head.</p>

<p>"I want to cut my initials on his shell
and let him go," he explained. "Then if
I catch him again when I'm grown up
I'll know him when I find him.... I'll
put the date under my initials, too,"
Johnnie added.</p>

<p>Farmer Green laughed.</p>

<p>"When you're grown up," he said,
"you'll have something else to do besides
catching snapping turtles. This afternoon
you may carve your initials on the hay-rake
and then take it over to the big
meadow and play with it."</p>

<p>For a few moments Johnnie Green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">p. 63</a></span>
couldn't help looking glum. He had intended
to visit the creek that very afternoon.
But now he knew that his father
expected him to work&mdash;to <i>work</i> on one of
the finest days of the whole summer!</p>

<p>"I'll let you off all day to-morrow,"
Farmer Green said. "And you know
there's that calf I told you I'd give you
if you helped me with the haying."</p>

<p>And then Johnnie actually smiled.</p>

<hr class="sorta" />

<p>Well, the next morning was just as fine
as the afternoon before. And Johnnie
Green set off early for Black Creek, with
his pockets stuffed full of cherries, because
he was afraid he might get hungry.
He ate a few of them on the way to the
creek. But when he reached that delightful
place he found something that made
him forget what he had in his pockets.
For there near the top of the bank, too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">p. 64</a></span>
far from the water to escape him&mdash;there
lay Timothy Turtle himself, taking a sun-bath
on the warm sand.</p>


<hr class="chapter" />
<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">p. 65</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>
<h3>CAUGHT!</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as Johnnie Green saw Mr. Turtle
he let out a loud whoop. And as soon as
Mr. Turtle saw Johnnie, <i>he</i> scrambled up
and made awkwardly for the water as fast
as he could go.</p>

<p>But Timothy's fastest, on land, was so
slow that Johnnie Green stopped him in
two seconds.</p>

<p>Catching up a long stick, Johnnie thrust
it in front of Timothy Turtle, who
promptly seized it in his hooked jaws.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green couldn't help laughing
at him.</p>

<p>"You're a stupid old fellow!" he cried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">p. 66</a></span>
"You could bite that stick all day and not
hurt me."</p>

<p>But Timothy Turtle said never a word.
He wished, however, that he could shift
his grip to one of Johnnie's bare toes. He
rather thought, if he could have done
that, that Johnnie Green would give such
a yell as had never before been heard in
Pleasant Valley.</p>

<p>But Johnnie was careful. After catching
Mr. Turtle he hardly knew what to do
with him. All summer long Johnnie had
kept his jackknife sharp as a razor, ready
to carve his initials on Mr. Turtle's hard
shell whenever the chance came. The
knife was in his pocket. There was Mr.
Turtle before him on the sand. And yet
Johnnie was puzzled.</p>

<p>Close at hand his captive looked fiercer
than he had appeared at a distance, lying
on a rock in the creek. And his jaws had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">p. 67</a></span>
closed upon the stick in a vise-like hold.
Johnnie winced when he tried to imagine
how he would feel with Mr. Turtle fastened
firmly to a toe or a finger.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant thought. But
Johnnie Green soon had a happier one:
why not turn the old scamp over upon his
back?</p>

<p>Johnnie had heard that a turtle was
helpless when upset in that way. And he
had already made up his mind to flop this
one over when he realized that even with
his captive upside down there was still a
certain difficulty.</p>

<p>To be sure, Mr. Turtle couldn't walk
away. But he could bite just the same.
And how was a boy going to carve his
initials on anybody's back, when that person
was lying on it?</p>

<p>Johnnie Green saw that that plan
wouldn't do at all. But he turned Timothy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">p. 68</a></span>
over, just for fun, upsetting him
neatly by lifting him on the stick&mdash;for
Timothy had not sense enough to let go
of it in time to save himself.</p>

<p>Johnnie stayed there only long enough
to make sure that Timothy Turtle was unable
to move. And he soon decided that
the savage old rascal would have to lie on
his back until somebody came along and
tipped him over. Then Johnnie Green
scampered away.</p>

<p>To be sure, Mr. Turtle wriggled his legs,
and twisted his neck about. But all his
wiggling and twisting were of not the
slightest help to him.</p>

<p>It was the first time in his long life that
he had ever found himself in that position
on land. And he was both frightened and
angry.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow, who had a way of knowing
when there was anything unusual going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">p. 69</a></span>
on, arrived in time to hear Timothy's
remarks. And what he said about boys&mdash;and
especially about Johnnie Green&mdash;made
Mr. Crow catch his breath.</p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV</h2>
<h3>THE REDSKINS' WAY</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Of</span> course Timothy Turtle was glad that
Johnnie Green was gone. But he was far
from happy, lying helpless on his back on
the bank of Black Creek.</p>

<p>He told Mr. Crow that he hoped Johnnie
would forget to come back again&mdash;a
remark which made old Mr. Crow laugh.
Being very wise, he saw at once that Timothy
Turtle knew next to nothing about
boys.</p>

<p>"I should think," Mr. Crow told Timothy,
"you'd want Johnnie Green to return."</p>

<p>"Why?" Timothy snapped out his question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">p. 71</a></span>
in an angry tone, as he lay there upside
down and stared at old Mr. Crow, who
sat in a tree near-by.</p>

<p>"Well," Mr. Crow answered, "who'll
set you on your feet again if he doesn't?"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about me!" Timothy
Turtle sneered. "I'll right myself as soon
as there's a freshet. If there's a big
enough rain the creek will rise as high as
I am now. And nobody could keep me on
my back in the water."</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow actually snickered.</p>

<p>"You might have to wait till next spring
for a freshet," he said cheerfully. "And
what would you eat meanwhile?"</p>

<p>Having had a hearty meal of fish just
before leaving the creek, Timothy Turtle
hadn't once thought of <i>eating</i>. And naturally
Mr. Crow's question troubled him.
So he frowned frightfully. And he
snapped his hooked jaws together, for he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">p. 72</a></span>
had to take something in his jaws and bite
it, if it was no more than the air.</p>

<p>"I suppose"&mdash;Mr. Crow remarked&mdash;"I
suppose you would call that <i>taking the
air, eh</i>?" And there was a merry twinkle
in his eye.</p>

<p>"Go away!" Timothy Turtle growled.</p>

<p>But his guest declined to leave.</p>

<p>"There's likely to be some fun here,"
he thought, "and I don't intend to miss
it."</p>

<hr class="sorta" />

<p>If Timothy Turtle was surprised, Mr.
Crow certainly was not, when a little later
Johnnie Green and another boy whom he
called "Red" (on account of his hair)
came hurrying up to the spot where Timothy
Turtle lay.</p>

<p>Upon the ground they dropped a number
of things, such as pieces of rope, an
old grain-sack, and an axe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">p. 73</a></span></p>

<p>"Goodness!" said Mr. Crow to himself,
as he looked on. "I'm glad I'm not Timothy
Turtle. It appears to me that he's
going to have a terrible time."</p>

<p>And Timothy himself seemed to think
the same. He made savage passes at
Johnnie and Red whenever they came near
him. But they took good care to keep beyond
his reach.</p>

<p>On the whole their captive behaved in
a most foolish manner. Instead of drawing
his head as far as he could into his
shell, he thrust his neck out as far as it
would go.</p>

<p>And that was exactly what the boys
wanted him to do. Before Timothy Turtle&mdash;who
was somewhat slow-witted&mdash;before
he realized what their plan was,
Johnnie Green and his friend Red had
slipped one noose around his head and another
around his body. And after turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">p. 74</a></span>
their captive right side up they staked
him out upon the sand so that he could not
move.</p>

<p>"There!" Johnnie Green cried when
they had Timothy Turtle where they
wanted him. "That's the way the Redskins
do with their enemies."</p>

<p>And his friend the red-haired boy
danced something that might have been
an Indian war dance.</p>

<p>Anyhow, neither old Mr. Crow nor Timothy
Turtle had ever seen anything like
it.</p>

<h3>JOHNNIE GREEN'S INITIALS</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Timothy Turtle</span> found himself in a very
uncomfortable position, staked out as he
was on the bank of Black Creek, with one
rope about his body and another about his
neck.</p>

<p>And even then Johnnie Green was not
satisfied. Though his friend Red insisted
that their captive could do them no harm
(saying, "How can he bite when he can't
move his head?") Johnnie Green replied
that he would "fix him" so there couldn't
possibly be any accident. And taking the
old grain-sack he had brought back with
him, he wrapped it carefully around Timothy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">p. 76</a></span>
head, till he looked for all the
world as if he had the earache.</p>

<p>"There!" Johnnie Green said, when he
had finished. "He'll have to bite through
that bag before he bites us; and I guess
he'll find he has a pretty big mouthful."</p>

<p>Then he pulled out his jackknife and felt
its sharp edge with his thumb.</p>

<p>"Lemme do it for you!" Red begged
him, holding out his hand for the knife.</p>

<p>But Johnnie Green had no such idea.</p>

<p>"No!" he said firmly. "I've got to cut
my initials myself."</p>

<p>"He might get loose and grab you," the
red-haired boy remarked hopefully.</p>

<p>But Johnnie Green told him that he
would risk that.</p>

<p>"Which way are you going to cut
them?" Red asked him.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Johnnie inquired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">p. 77</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you going to make 'em read when
he's going or coming?" Red explained.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that," Johnnie
Green replied. "But I guess <i>going</i> would
be better. Then if he stands up you can
read 'em just the same, without any
trouble."</p>

<p>So Johnnie kneeled down beside Timothy
Turtle. It took him some time to
decide just where he would carve his initials
on Timothy's shell. And he had
about decided that the best place to put
his mark on Mr. Turtle's back would be
exactly in the middle of it, when he cried
all at once, "Look, Red! Look!"</p>

<p>"Whassamatter?" the red-haired boy
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"This is the queerest thing I ever heard
of!" Johnnie exclaimed. "Here are my
initials already cut!"</p>

<p>Red could not believe him, until he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">p. 78</a></span>
peered at Timothy's shell himself. And
then he saw that what Johnnie had said
was true.</p>

<p>"There's a date, too," Johnnie pointed
out. And he read it aloud. "That's
more'n thirty years ago," he declared.</p>

<p>But the red-haired boy laughed boisterously.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" he jeered. "Somebody's
been playin' a joke on you. Somebody
knew you were lookin' for this old turtle
and put your initials and that old date on
him just to puzzle you."</p>

<p>Johnnie Green didn't know exactly
what to think. But probably he was no
more upset than was Timothy Turtle,
who was not having a good time at all.</p>

<p>"I don't care if some one did catch this
turtle first," Johnnie said at last. "I'm
going to carve my mark on him just the
same."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">p. 79</a></span></p>

<p>So he began to cut "J. G." in the exact
center of the back of Timothy Turtle,
much to that old fellow's rage.</p>

<p>And when Johnnie Green had finished
the letters he cut the date below them.</p>

<p>"What you goin' to do with him now?"
Red asked Johnnie then.</p>

<p>"Turn him loose!" Johnnie replied.</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;don't do that! Lemme have
him!" Red coaxed.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green said that he was sorry&mdash;but
he intended to set his captive free, just
as he had planned.</p>

<p>He soon found that turning Mr. Turtle
loose was no easy matter. Strange to say,
Timothy Turtle did nothing to help. On
the contrary, he made the task as hard as
he could for Johnnie Green, trying his
best to bite that young man.</p>

<p>In the end Johnnie had to cut the rope
that held Timothy's head. And when that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">p. 80</a></span>
furious old fellow at last found himself in
Black Creek once more he still wore a
noose of rope, like a collar, around his
neck.</p>

<hr class="sorta" />

<p>When Johnnie Green told his father
about his adventure with Timothy Turtle,
he had a great surprise. Farmer
Green said that when he was just about
Johnnie's age he had cut <i>his</i> initials on a
turtle, down by the creek.</p>

<p>Now, since Johnnie was named for his
father, their initials had to be alike. So
the J. G.&mdash;and the old date&mdash;that Johnnie
had found must have been carved by
Farmer Green when he was a youngster.</p>

<p>Somehow, Johnnie found it very hard
to imagine that his father had ever been
a boy like himself and had spent his time
playing near the creek, and carving his
initials on the back of a turtle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">p. 81</a></span></p>

<p>"How old do you suppose that turtle
is?" he asked his father.</p>

<p>"Oh, he must be a regular old settler,"
Farmer Green declared. "He may have
been around here when your grandfather
was a boy, for all I know."</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that?" Johnnie
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well," his father answered, "there's
only one way to find out."</p>

<p>"What's that?" Johnnie inquired eagerly.</p>

<p>"Ask Mr. Turtle himself," Farmer
Green replied with a smile.</p>

<h3>TIMOTHY NEEDS HELP</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> who lived near Black Creek
noticed Timothy Turtle's new collar. And
almost every one, being curious, asked Mr.
Turtle where he got it, and why he was
wearing it.</p>

<p>Now, Timothy Turtle would give such
folk no answer at all. But old Mr. Crow
knew what had happened&mdash;of course.
And he took pains to tell all his
friends how Johnnie Green had caught
Timothy and tied a rope around his neck,
and cut something on Timothy's back, besides.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">
<a name="illus-004" id="illus-004"></a>
<img src="images/illus-095.jpg" alt='"Let me go!" Fatty Coon shrieked.'
title='"Let me go!" Fatty Coon shrieked.' width="384" height="550" /><br />
<span class="caption">"Let me go!" Fatty Coon shrieked.</span>
</div>

<p>So it was not long before Timothy Turtle's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>neighbors began to ask him what was
on his back.</p>

<p>"My shell's on my back!" he snapped,
when any one put that question to him.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but what's on your shell?"
everybody was sure to answer back.</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle couldn't have replied to
that question, even if he had wanted to.
And though he always sneered when hearing
it and turned his head away, as if the
matter was something he didn't care to
talk about, there was nobody who was any
more eager to know the answer than he.</p>

<p>To be sure, by raising his head he could
get a slanting view of the top of his shell.
But such a glimpse was not enough to tell
him anything.</p>

<p>Under the constant inquiries of his
neighbors Timothy's curiosity grew
every day. Soon he took to staring at his
reflection in the surface of the water, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">p. 84</a></span>
the hope that he might be able to see his
back in that way.</p>

<p>But it was all in vain. Though Timothy
twisted and turned and stretched his
long neck, he couldn't see his own back,
no matter how much he tried.</p>

<p>Now, there was an ill-mannered scamp
named Peter Mink who happened to go
prowling up the creek one day. And as
he quietly rounded a bend he came upon
an odd sight.</p>

<p>In front of him, and perched on a rock
in the midst of the water, Timothy Turtle
was going through the queerest motions.
He seemed to be peering into the water at
something, while wriggling about in a most
peculiar fashion.</p>

<p>He did not notice Peter Mink, who stood
stock still and watched him for some time
without speaking.</p>

<p>At last Peter's prying ways got the better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">p. 85</a></span>
of him. He simply had to say something.</p>

<p>"What on earth are you doing!" he
called to Timothy.</p>

<p>Mr. Turtle gave a great start.</p>

<p>"I'm looking at myself&mdash;that's all," he
said. He was so surprised that for once
he actually answered a question politely.</p>

<p>His reply amused Peter Mink. And
that ill-bred rascal laughed right in Timothy
Turtle's face.</p>

<p>"Time must hang heavy on your hands,
if you can't find anything pleasanter to
do than that," he remarked&mdash;for Peter
Mink never cared how rude he was. In
fact he liked to make unkind remarks.
"Aren't you afraid," he added, "that
you'll wear out the surface of the creek,
gazing into it? I shouldn't like that very
well," said Peter Mink, "because then it
couldn't freeze in winter, and you know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">p. 86</a></span>
it's great sport to hunt muskrats under
the ice."</p>

<p>Well, Peter's speech alarmed Timothy
Turtle. And yet he felt that he could not
rest until he knew what was on his back.
So he asked Peter Mink to meet him on
the bank.</p>

<p>"I want you to help me," he said. "I
have reason to believe that there's something
written on my back. And you must
tell me what it is."</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII</h2>
<h3>PETER MINK'S PLAN</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> Peter Mink had never learned to
read. In the first place, he had never had
a chance to learn. And in the second, he
was such a good-for-nothing rascal that
he wouldn't have gone to school anyhow.</p>

<p>But he did not tell all this to Timothy
Turtle. When he stepped behind Timothy
and gazed at his back, Peter Mink
thought of a fine way to tease the old fellow.</p>

<p>Of course, he had not the slightest idea
what those marks on Mr. Turtle's shell
meant. But he looked down at them with
a wise smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">p. 88</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Turtle, watching Peter out of the
corner of his eye, saw that smile; and he
did not like it in the least. In fact, it
made him feel quite peevish.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you see?" he asked
Peter Mink impatiently.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Peter Mink replied with a shake
of his small head. "I'm not going to tell
you, Mr. Turtle. I don't want to hurt
your feelings. And if I were to explain
that your back says you're a disagreeable,
mean old scamp, you know you'd be very
angry."</p>

<p>Peter Mink jumped out of the way just
in time. For Timothy Turtle wheeled
with amazing swiftness and snapped at
his tormentor.</p>

<p>"Don't do that!" Peter cried. "<i>I</i>
didn't say anything about you, Mr. Turtle."</p>

<p>"You'd better not," Timothy warned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">p. 89</a></span>
him. "And if Johnnie Green carved any
such words as those on my shell I don't
know what to do. I certainly don't want
to carry them about with me for the rest
of my life." He looked unhappy, to say
the least. He knew that probably he would
live a great many years longer. And he
was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get a new shell?"
Peter Mink inquired.</p>

<p>"I'd hate to do that," Timothy Turtle
told him. "I've had this one a long time;
and it fits me perfectly."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you get the well-known
tailor, Mr. Ferdinand Frog, to
make you a coat that will cover your
back? If you did that, nobody could see
what's on your shell."</p>

<p>"A good idea!" Timothy Turtle exclaimed.
"I'll see Mr. Frog at once. And
some day I'll do something handsome for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">p. 90</a></span>
you, because you've been a great help to
me."</p>

<p>"Why wait?" Peter Mink demanded.
"Why don't you do it now?" Knowing
that Timothy was stingy, Peter thought
that the old gentleman would soon change
his mind about "doing something handsome"
for him.</p>

<p>"No!" Timothy Turtle declared. "I
want to wait a while and think it over."</p>

<p>"Well, then," Peter Mink urged him,
"why don't you crawl under that shelving
rock and think it over right now?"</p>

<p>"You ask too many questions," Mr.
Turtle told him. "And besides, I must
hurry away and find Ferdinand Frog. I
want my new coat as soon as I can get it.
And the longer I stay here, the more time
I shall lose." So in spite of all Peter
Mink could say, Timothy slipped into
Black Creek and swam away.</p>

<h3>CAREFUL MR. FROG</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Somebody</span> had knocked. And with a wide
smile upon his face Mr. Ferdinand Frog,
the tailor, went to his door and peeped
out.</p>

<p>One look was enough. He shut the
door again with great haste and barred it.
And he held one hand over his heart, as if
he had just received a terrible fright.</p>

<p>"Let me in!" somebody called. The
tailor knew that it was Timothy Turtle's
voice, for he had seen that crusty old person
standing upon his doorstep.</p>

<p>"Go away!" Mr. Frog replied. "I'm
not here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">p. 92</a></span></p>

<p>He was an odd chap&mdash;this Ferdinand
Frog. One never could tell what he was
going to do&mdash;or say.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are!" Timothy Turtle insisted.
"I saw you only a moment ago."</p>

<p>The tailor then peered out of the window
at his caller.</p>

<p>"There you are now!" Timothy shouted,
as he caught sight of Mr. Frog. "I
say, let me in!"</p>

<p>"I can't," Mr. Frog answered. "I'm
sick a-bed."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Timothy cried.</p>

<p>"Well, I expect I'll be ill if you don't
go away," the tailor answered. "I'm having
a nervous chill this very moment."</p>

<p>He was afraid of Timothy Turtle. And
it was no wonder. For Timothy had tried,
more than once to make a meal of the nimble
Mr. Frog.</p>

<p>"I haven't come here to hurt you,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">p. 93</a></span>
Timothy Turtle explained, trying to smile
at the face in the window. "I want you
to make me a new coat&mdash;a big one that will
cover my back all over."</p>

<p>To his great disappointment Mr. Frog
shook his head with great force.</p>

<p>"I'm not interested," he announced.</p>

<p>"Do you mean"&mdash;Timothy Turtle faltered&mdash;"do
you mean that you won't
make a coat for me?"</p>

<p>"Exactly!"</p>

<p>"Why?" Timothy pressed him.</p>

<p>"Too busy!" was Mr. Frog's answer.</p>

<p>"Who is?"</p>

<p>"You are!" said Mr. Frog. "Ever
since I've known you, you've been trying
to catch me and my friends."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;I was only joking," Timothy
Turtle told him. "You mustn't mind
my playful ways. Just make me a coat
and I'll do something handsome for you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">p. 94</a></span></p>

<p>It was now the tailor's turn to ask questions.</p>

<p>"What"&mdash;he inquired&mdash;"what will you
do?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't just say at this moment,"
Timothy replied.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd want to think a while," said
Timothy Turtle.</p>

<p>"Very well!" was the tailor's answer.
"I've no objection, though it's something
I never do myself."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd come outside a moment,
since you don't want me inside your
shop," Timothy remarked. "I'd like to
whisper to you."</p>

<p>"I'm deaf," Mr. Frog informed him.
"I couldn't hear a single word, even if
you were to shout your head off."</p>

<p>"You can hear what I'm saying now
well enough," Timothy pointed out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">p. 95</a></span></p>

<p>"I read the lips," said Mr. Frog with a
snicker.</p>

<p>That speech made Timothy Turtle
start.</p>

<p>"Then if you can read my lips, no doubt
you can read what's on my back," he
said.</p>

<p>"That's easy," the tailor observed.
"Your shell's on your back, of course."</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle glanced up with a look
of scorn.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly!" he snapped. "I mean,
can you read what's carved on my shell?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" Mr. Frog replied. And
he began to mutter, as if to himself, "J. G.&mdash;that
means <i>just grumpy</i>, of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle interrupted him quickly.</p>

<p>"I don't care to hear any more," he
screamed. And turning away, he waddled
towards the water.</p>

<p>"That Ferdinand Frog has no manners,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">p. 96</a></span>
he spluttered. "I only wish he
wasn't quite so spry." And Mr. Turtle
looked very fierce as he snapped his jaws
together.</p>

<h3>THE ALMANAC</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">One</span> rainy night Peter Mink stopped at
Black Creek; and calling loudly to Timothy
Turtle he asked for a place to sleep.</p>

<p>"You remember," he said, when Timothy
drew himself upon the bank, "you
told me that you would do something
handsome for me some time. And now
that I'm wet and tired I hope you can
offer me a snug, dry spot in which to spend
the night."</p>

<p>"What can you do to pay me?" asked
Timothy Turtle. He never did anything
for anybody without pay. "Can you saw
wood?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">p. 98</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Peter Mink would rather stay out
in the rain forever than saw a single stick
of wood. So he said:</p>

<p>"No, I can't!" just like that.</p>

<p>"Well, it's about time you learned,"
said Timothy Turtle.</p>

<p>Peter Mink was about to leave in disgust;
and he was wondering what name
he would call Timothy Turtle, when he
was a little further away, when he noticed
that Timothy had a thin book in his hand.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Peter asked.</p>

<p>"It's the Farmer's Almanac," said
Timothy Turtle. "I've been looking
through it; but my eyes are bad and I
can't read."</p>

<p>Now that was quite true; for Timothy's
eyes <i>were</i> bad&mdash;and he had never learned
to read.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," Peter Mink
announced. "If you'll give me a place to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">p. 99</a></span>
spend the night I'll read the Farmer's Almanac
to you."</p>

<p>"Come right in!" Timothy Turtle cried,
leading the way to a cozy nook beneath a
big rock which was not far from the
water. And Peter Mink was very glad to
creep inside that comfortable shelter. He
took the Almanac from Timothy Turtle
and they both sat down.</p>

<p>Peter opened the book.</p>

<p>"I see," he said, "that it says the
weather was fair to-day, but look out for
a heavy rain to-night!"</p>

<p>Now, Timothy Turtle had not felt quite
sure that Peter Mink knew how to read.
But when he heard that he quickly
changed his mind.</p>

<p>"That's exactly what's happened!" he
exclaimed. And he was greatly pleased.</p>

<p>But the next moment he noticed that
Peter Mink was holding the book upside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">p. 100</a></span>
down. Timothy could tell that because
the picture of the man ploughing, on the
cover, was upside down.</p>

<p>"You can't read!" he cried angrily.
"You don't even know how to hold a
book. You've got it bottom side up!"</p>

<p>But Peter Mink only smiled pleasantly
at him.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," he said.
"That's the way I was taught to read.
Then, if you want to read when standing
on your head, you don't need to turn the
book over.... It's the latest method,"
he explained.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Timothy Turtle. "That's
different!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;quite different!" said Peter
Mink.</p>

<p>"What does the Almanac say about next
week?" Timothy inquired.</p>

<p>"Time to plant corn!" Peter told him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">p. 101</a></span></p>

<p>"That's so!" said Timothy Turtle.
"Mr. Crow was telling me this very day
that Farmer Green was ploughing his
cornfield; but of course that doesn't interest
me much.... What else does the
book say?" Timothy continued.</p>

<p>"Well, here's some general advice,"
Peter Mink remarked, as he looked at the
Almanac again. "It says: 'If anybody
comes to you and asks for a place to sleep,
give him a bed&mdash;but first of all, give him a
good supper.'"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I want to hear any
more to-night," said Timothy Turtle hastily.
"It's late; so we'd better go to bed
right away."</p>

<p>Peter Mink was somewhat disappointed.
He had hoped to get a fish or two to eat.
But there was nothing he could say,
though he did wish Timothy Turtle could
take a hint.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">p. 102</a></span></p>

<p>"In the morning you can read to me
again," Timothy told him.</p>

<p>So they went to bed.</p>

<p>But in the morning the Almanac was
nowhere to be found. Timothy Turtle
hunted for it in every place he could think
of&mdash;except Peter Mink's pocket.</p>

<p>After Peter had gone, Timothy continued
his search. And at last he found
the Almanac beneath the heap of dry
leaves which Peter Mink had used for a
bed.</p>

<p>"That's queer!" Timothy Turtle said.
"I'm almost sure I looked there before
Peter Mink went away.... My eyes
must be growing worse."</p>

<p>The more he thought of the matter, the
gladder he was that he hadn't found the
book before. For there was no knowing
but that Peter Mink might have found
some advice about giving a good breakfast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">p. 103</a></span>
to a guest who stayed over night.</p>

<p>Then Timothy Turtle went into Black
Creek and caught a fine fish, for he was
hungry. And he enjoyed his meal mightily,
because he had it all to himself.</p>

<p>While he was eating he kept thinking
what a disagreeable fellow Peter Mink
was. No doubt he would have been surprised
had he known that Peter Mink was
thinking the same thing about <i>him</i>, at exactly
the same moment.</p>

<h3>A QUEER WISH</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Fishing</span> was one of Timothy Turtle's
favorite sports. He was a skillful fisherman,
too. And though it only happened
once that he caught more than one fish at
a time, on that occasion he captured seven.
This was the way it happened:</p>

<p>Johnnie Green had come to Black
Creek to fish for pickerel. And Timothy
Turtle was much annoyed when he found
Johnnie fishing in the pool that he liked
best of all. Timothy thought it was mean
of Johnnie Green to catch <i>his</i> fish, in <i>his</i>
creek.</p>

<p>And Timothy's beady eyes glared as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">p. 105</a></span>
watched Johnnie from a safe hiding-place
under the bank.</p>

<p>He saw that Johnnie Green was a good
fisherman. Before he moved on he caught
three big fish from that pool; and one of
them&mdash;the biggest of the three&mdash;was the
very fish on which Timothy Turtle had
been expecting to dine that day.</p>

<p>It was really no wonder that he was annoyed.
And when Johnnie went further
up the creek to try his luck elsewhere
Timothy Turtle slipped into the water
and followed him.</p>

<p>The more fish he saw Johnnie Green
catch, the angrier Timothy grew. And he
went out of his way to tell a number of his
neighbors what was happening.</p>

<p>"Something ought to be done about it!"
he complained.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go down and speak to
Farmer Green?" Peter Mink suggested.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">p. 106</a></span>
Peter liked fish, too. And he had often
said that Johnnie had no right to take food
away from him, when everybody knew
that there was a plenty at the farmhouse.</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle did not care for Peter's
suggestion.</p>

<p>"I've no time to waste talking to Farmer
Green," he said. "It seems to me a
letter would be better. Now, if somebody
would write a letter, and get everybody to
sign his name to it, and send it down to
Farmer Green by a messenger, I would do
my share to help. I would tell the messenger
where to leave the letter so that
Farmer Green would be sure to find it."
Timothy then said that he must hurry
back to the creek, for he wanted to see
how many fish Johnnie Green took, so
the number could be mentioned in the letter.
But before he left Timothy told
Peter Mink to go and find somebody to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">p. 107</a></span>
write the letter. "There's old Mr. Crow,"
Timothy said. "You might ask him. He
could use one of his quills for a pen, you
know."</p>

<p>When Timothy Turtle reached the creek
once more he found that while he was
talking to Peter Mink, Johnnie Green
had moved oh again.</p>

<p>So Timothy started to follow him. But
what should he see, lying on the bank right
before him, but a string of seven pickerel!
Johnnie Green had left them there, while
he went still further up the creek to catch
more.</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle suddenly changed his
mind about sending a letter to Farmer
Green. He wished that Johnnie would
come there to fish every day.</p>

<p>"He's a kind boy, after all!" said Timothy
Turtle to himself. "I never dreamed
that he was catching these fish for me. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">p. 108</a></span>
here they are, waiting for me! For Johnnie
must have known that I would find
them."</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle didn't say anything
more. Of course he was only talking to
himself, anyhow. And he seized the
string of pickerel and waddled into the
bushes, where he ate every one of those
seven fish.</p>

<p>When Peter Mink met Timothy the
next day he said he had not yet found
anybody who would write the letter to
Farmer Green.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crow told me that if it was anybody
but you he might be willing to pull
out one of his quills for a pen," Peter
explained. "But he said that he hoped
Johnnie Green would come here every
day to fish, until there are no fish left for
you."</p>

<p>Timothy Turtle sniffed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">p. 109</a></span></p>

<p>"You go back," he directed Peter
Mink, "and tell Mr. Crow that <i>I</i> hope
Johnnie Green will come here <i>twice a
day</i> until he has caught every fish in Black
Creek."</p>

<p>Peter Mink thought that that was a
queer thing for Timothy to wish. Neither
he nor old Mr. Crow could understand it.</p>

<h3>THE UNWELCOME GUEST</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Ferdinand Frog</span> did not like Timothy
Turtle. But he always said he thought
Mr. Turtle could be <i>trusted</i>.</p>

<p>"You can <i>depend</i> on him," Mr. Frog
often remarked. "Yes, you can depend
on him to grab you if he ever gets a
chance."</p>

<p>And all the rest of the musical Frog
family agreed with him.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that
they never invited Timothy Turtle to attend
their singing parties in Cedar
Swamp. It made no difference how much
Timothy Turtle hinted. Though he frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">p. 111</a></span>
took pains to tell Ferdinand Frog
how fond he was of music, Mr. Frog
never once asked him to come to a concert.</p>

<p>In private Mr. Frog and his friends
often spoke of Mr. Turtle&mdash;and giggled.
And one of the Frog family even made up
a song about Timothy Turtle, which the
whole company loved to chant in Cedar
Swamp, safe&mdash;as they thought&mdash;from
Timothy's snapping jaws.</p>

<p>But one fine summer's evening they had
a great surprise. They had scarcely begun
their nightly concert when Timothy
Turtle appeared, out of the water and
crawled upon an old stump, right in their
midst.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" he cried. "I was just
passing on my way home; and hearing the
singing, I thought I'd stop and enjoy it."</p>

<p>For a few moments none of the Frog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">p. 112</a></span>
family said a word. And then Ferdinand
Frog spoke up and asked Mr. Turtle a
question:</p>

<p>"Have you had your dinner?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't," Timothy answered.
"But you needn't trouble yourselves on
my account. Go on with your singing.
And if I feel faint no doubt I can find a
bite to eat hereabouts."</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Turtle hoped that his speech
would put the singers quite at their ease.
But they looked at one another and rolled
their eyes as if to say, "This Timothy
Turtle is a dangerous person. Look out
for him!"</p>

<p>At the same time they did not wish to
appear frightened. And Ferdinand
Frog's mother's uncle even made a short
speech, saying that he hoped Mr. Turtle
would enjoy the singing half as much as
everybody else enjoyed his company.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">p. 113</a></span></p>

<p>He was about to make some further remark.
But no one knew what. For
Timothy Turtle wheeled about to look at
the old gentleman. And the moment
Timothy moved, Ferdinand Frog's mother's
uncle jumped hastily into the water
from the hummock where he had been sitting,
and swam away.</p>

<p>The rest of the company then sang a
song. And their listener said that he had
never heard anything like it.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd sing it again," he said,
"with your mouths open and your eyes
shut."</p>

<p>But the musical Frog family objected
that they were not used to singing in that
fashion.</p>

<p>"Why don't you keep your own eyes
shut?" Ferdinand Frog asked Mr. Turtle.
"Then you wouldn't know whether
ours were open or closed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">p. 114</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us <i>all</i> shut our eyes!" Timothy
Turtle then suggested. And when the
Frog family began another song, a few of
the younger and more foolish singers followed
Mr. Turtle's advice.</p>

<p>So, too, did Mr. Turtle himself&mdash;<i>for a
few moments</i>.</p>

<p>But he soon opened his eyes slyly. And
he became very angry when he saw that
most of the singers were watching him.</p>

<p>"You aren't doing as I asked you!" he
shouted.</p>

<h3>A MERRY SONG</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Timothy Turtle</span> made such a noise that
the Frog family had to stop singing.</p>

<p>"It's not fair!" he cried. "You're
peeping!"</p>

<p>"Well, so are you!" Ferdinand Frog retorted.</p>

<p>"I only opened my eyes to make sure
that you were doing as I asked you to,"
Mr. Turtle replied with an injured air.</p>

<p>"And we didn't shut ours, because we
wanted to watch <i>you</i>," said Mr. Frog.</p>

<p>"Can't you trust me?" Timothy
snapped.</p>

<p>"Certainly!" Ferdinand Frog replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">p. 116</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes! We can trust you!" And he
winked at his friends.</p>

<p>"You don't want to hurt my feelings,
do you?" Timothy Turtle went on.</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" everybody exclaimed.</p>

<p>And then Ferdinand Frog told Timothy
that they would sing a special song
in his honor.</p>

<p>"Fire away!" Timothy ordered them.
And the whole company knew, when he
said that, that if he really cared anything
at all for singing he never would have
spoken of it in that fashion.</p>

<p>They were just about to begin the song
when Timothy Turtle stopped them.</p>

<p>"What's this thing called?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"It's known," Ferdinand Frog explained,
"as 'A Merry Song.'"</p>

<p>And then the whole Frog family began
to bellow their loudest:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">p. 117</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come let us sing a merry song!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To you it may sound sad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if you think it loud and long<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>We</i> think that it's not bad.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We'll sing about a grumpy one<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who snaps and bites all day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if you call that "having fun"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We make reply, "Go 'way!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He has a glittering, wicked eye<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And also cruel jaws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if you ask the reason why,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We'll answer you, <i>"Because!"</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He'll stretch his neck and grab you quick&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Don't let him come too near!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if you poke him with a stick<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He'll seize that too&mdash;oh, dear!
</span><p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">p. 118</a></span></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, we'll admit he swims quite well<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And that he's slow ashore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't ask us if he wears a shell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Until we tell you more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Don't ask us if he's fond of fish<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor seek to learn his age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kindly don't express a wish<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To see him in a rage!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Don't ask us if his claws are strong<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And if he has a tail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It might be short and blunt, or long<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pointed like a nail.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We do not want to cause you pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We would not give offense&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, sir, you'll not come here again<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If you have any sense.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After the last echo of the song had lost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">p. 119</a></span>
itself in the depths of Cedar Swamp, the
singers all turned, smiling, to their
listener.</p>

<p>But his face wore no smile. On the contrary,
Timothy Turtle frowned darkly.</p>

<p>"You can't fool me!" he cried. "You
don't like me! You don't want me here!"</p>

<p>Ferdinand Frog swallowed a few times.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "of course my manners
are so elegant that I simply <i>couldn't</i>
dispute one of my elders. And anyhow,
Mr. Turtle, you'd find that our singing
sounded twice as well if you were half a
mile away."</p>

<p>"It certainly couldn't sound any worse
than it does here," Timothy Turtle declared&mdash;a
remark which made the Frog
family grin broadly.</p>

<p>He said no more, but slipped into the
water and struck out towards home.</p>

<p>There was a lively scattering of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">p. 120</a></span>
who found themselves in Timothy Turtle's
path. And for a time it looked as if
the singing party had broken up in disorder.</p>

<p>But after a while everybody came back
again&mdash;that is, everybody but Timothy
Turtle. He hurried away and spent most
of the whole night buried in the mud at
the bottom of Black Creek. For even until
daybreak that merry song came floating
now and then across Pleasant Valley.</p>

<p>And Timothy Turtle did not like it. He
thought it not only loud and long, but most
unpleasant as well.</p>
